# AntColonyOptimization

An implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization Problem. There is at least one ant hill and various food sources outside of the ant hill(s). The goal for the ants is to find the sources of food and bring the food back to the ant hill(s). Ants may leave pheromones wherever they go, so other the ants can follow each other. The run is considered successful if all of the food is eventually retrieved. This is an example of an autonomous, multi-agent system coded on [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). 

## Running Our Code

Go to [this website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.3.1/) to download NetLogo for your computer. Then, after you install everything, go to File => Open => `AntColonyOptimization.nlogo` to open our model. Once our model is opened, the code and notes on the program can easily be seen in the `Info` and `Code` tabs. Press SETUP, and then GO, to see our ants in action!

Alternatively, `AntColonyOptimization.nlogo` can be loaded into [this website](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Biology/Ants.nlogo) through the link at the top right corner. Then, all of the details and code can be seen at the bottom.

## Our Data

All of our data and analyses can be found in [`Analysis.md`](https://github.com/lemmo031/AntColonyOptimization/blob/master/Analysis.md).
